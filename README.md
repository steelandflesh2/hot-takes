# Hot Takes

![Avatar](avatar.webp)

Hot Takes is a fun and engaging bot with various topics deemed as bold or mildly controversial (nothing political or NSFW, eg. Pineapple is the best topping on a Pizza) to help the community to engage on various topics.
Basically, a player can use the `>play` command to get a random hot pick out of a variety of topics and the community could react with "✅" if the pick is approved or "❌" if not.

# Improvements and future goals

Right now, this is just a toy project, to make this a real project more topics should be added and probably an actual database should be integrated instead of loading text files.
